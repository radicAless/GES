# GES
For the final project of the Causal Network course, I had to implement GES.
The project is written as a Colab Notebook, so loading the files on Google Drive is recommended. The notebook displays how GES works on the data stored in the '.csv' file. The code is ready for immediate use.

GES (short for Greedy Equivalence Search) is a score-based algorithm for causal inference which tries to find the causal network behind the observational data. You can find a full description on GES functioning in the Google Colab file.
