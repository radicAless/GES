# GES
For the final project of the Causal Network course, I had to implement GES.
The project is written as a Colab Notebook, ready for immediate use.

GES (short for Greedy Equivalence Search) is a score-based algorithm for causal inference which tries to find the causal network behind the observational data. You can find a full description in the Google Colab file.
